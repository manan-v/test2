The bug causes libxml2's HTML4 parser to fail to recover when encountering a bare <code>&lt;</code> character in some contexts. This version of Nokogiri restores the earlier behavior, which is to recover from the parse error and treat the <code>&lt;</code> as normal character data (which will be serialized as <code>&amp;lt;</code> in a text node). The bug (and the fix) is only relevant when the <code>RECOVER</code> parse option is set, as it is by default.

Non-string parameters (e.g., integers and symbols) are now explicitly supported and both keys and values will be stringified with <code>#to_s</code>. [<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2418\">#2418</a>]</li>\n<li>Fix CSS selector query regression in v1.13.0 that raised an <code>Nokogiri::XML::XPath::SyntaxError</code> when parsing XPath attributes mixed into the CSS query. Although this mash-up of XPath and CSS syntax previously worked unintentionally, it is now an officially supported feature and is documented as such.

We don't yet have CI running for this platform, and so we're interested in hearing back from y'all whether this is working, and what problems you're seeing.

in libxml 2.9.13 (introduced in Nokogiri v1.13.2). The bug causes libxml2's HTML4 parser to fail to recover when encountering a bare <code>&lt;</code> character in some contexts. This version of Nokogiri restores the earlier behavior, which is to recover from the parse error and treat the <code>&lt;</code> as normal character data (which will be serialized as <code>&amp;lt;</code> in a text node). The bug (and the fix) is only relevant when the <code>RECOVER</code> parse option is set, as it is by default.

The bug causes libxml2's HTML4 parser to fail to recover when encountering a bare <code>&lt;</code> character in some contexts. This version of Nokogiri restores the earlier behavior, which is to recover from the parse error and treat the <code>&lt;</code> as normal character data (which will be serialized as <code>&amp;lt;</code> in a text node). The bug (and the fix) is only relevant when the <code>RECOVER</code> parse option is set, as it is by default.

Although this mash-up of XPath and CSS syntax previously worked unintentionally, it is now an officially supported feature and is documented as such.

We don't yet have CI running for this platform, and so we're interested in hearing back from y'all whether this is working, and what problems you're seeing.

The bug causes libxml2's HTML4 parser to fail to recover when encountering a bare <code>&lt;</code> character in some contexts. This version of Nokogiri restores the earlier behavior, which is to recover from the parse error and treat the <code>&lt;</code> as normal character data (which will be serialized as <code>&amp;lt;</code> in a text node). The bug (and the fix) is only relevant when the <code>RECOVER</code> parse option is set, as it is by default.

Non-string parameters (e.g., integers and symbols) are now explicitly supported and both keys and values will be stringified with <code>#to_s</code>.

Although this mash-up of XPath and CSS syntax previously worked unintentionally, it is now an officially supported feature and is documented as such.

2022-02-21</h2>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[CRuby] Revert a HTML4 parser bug in libxml 2.9.13 (introduced in Nokogiri v1.13.2). The bug causes libxml2's HTML4 parser to fail to recover when encountering a bare <code>&lt;</code> character in some contexts. This version of Nokogiri restores the earlier behavior, which is to recover from the parse error and treat the <code>&lt;</code> as normal character data (which will be serialized as <code>&amp;lt;</code> in a text node). The bug (and the fix) is only relevant when the <code>RECOVER</code> parse option is set, as it is by default.

2022-02-21</h2>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[CRuby] Revert a HTML4 parser bug in libxml 2.9.13 (introduced in Nokogiri v1.13.2). The bug causes libxml2's HTML4 parser to fail to recover when encountering a bare <code>&lt;</code> character in some contexts. This version of Nokogiri restores the earlier behavior, which is to recover from the parse error and treat the <code>&lt;</code> as normal character data (which will be serialized as <code>&amp;lt;</code> in a text node). The bug (and the fix) is only relevant when the <code>RECOVER</code> parse option is set, as it is by default.

external entities (XXE) by default. This fix turns off entity-resolution-by-default in the JRuby SAX parsers to match the CRuby SAX parsers' behavior.</p>\n<p>CRuby users are not affected by this CVE.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[CRuby] <code>Document#to_xhtml</code> properly serializes self-closing tags in libxml &gt; 2.9.10. A behavior change introduced in libxml 2.9.11 resulted in emitting start and and tags (e.g., <code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</code>) instead of a self-closing tag (e.g., <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>) in previous Nokogiri versions.

This fix turns off entity-resolution-by-default in the JRuby SAX parsers to match the CRuby SAX parsers' behavior.</p>\n<p>CRuby users are not affected by this CVE.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[CRuby] <code>Document#to_xhtml</code> properly serializes self-closing tags in libxml &gt; 2.9.10. A behavior change introduced in libxml 2.9.11 resulted in emitting start and and tags (e.g., <code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</code>) instead of a self-closing tag (e.g., <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>) in previous Nokogiri versions. [<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2324\">#2324</a>]</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.12.4 / 2021-08-29</h2>\n<h3>Notable fix: Namespace inheritance</h3>\n<p>Namespace behavior when reparenting nodes has historically been poorly specified and the behavior diverged between CRuby and JRuby. As a result, making this behavior consistent in v1.12.0 introduced a breaking change.</p>\n<p>This patch release reverts the Builder behavior present in v1.12.0..v1.12.3 but keeps the Document behavior. This release also introduces a Document attribute to allow affected users to easily change this behavior for their legacy code without invasive changes.</p>\n<h4>Compensating Feature in XML::Document</h4>\n<p>This release of Nokogiri introduces a new <code>Document</code> boolean attribute, <code>namespace_inheritance</code>, which controls whether children should inherit a namespace when they are reparented. <code>Nokogiri::XML:Document</code> defaults this attribute to <code>false</code> meaning &quot;do not inherit,&quot; thereby making explicit the behavior change introduced in v1.12.0.</p>\n<p>CRuby users who desire the pre-v1.12.0 behavior may set <code>document.namespace_inheritance = true</code> before reparenting nodes.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Document.html#namespace_inheritance-instance_method\">https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Document.html#namespace_inheritance-instance_method</a> for example usage.</p>\n<h4>Fix for XML::Builder</h4>\n<p>However, recognizing that we want <code>Builder</code>-created children to inherit namespaces, Builder now will set <code>namespace_inheritance=true</code> on the underlying document for both JRuby and CRuby. This means that, on CRuby, the pre-v1.12.0 behavior is restored.</p>\n<p>Users who want to turn this behavior off may pass a keyword argument to the Builder constructor like so:</p>\n<pre lang=\"ruby\"><code>Nokogiri::XML::Builder.new(namespace_inheritance: false)\n</code></pre>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Builder.html#label-Namespace+inheritance\">https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Builder.html#label-Namespace+inheritance</a> for example usage.</p>\n<h4>Downstream gem maintainers</h4>\n<p>Note that any downstream gems may want to specifically omit Nokogiri v1.12.0--v1.12.3 from their dependency specification if they rely on child namespace inheritance:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

2022-02-21</h2>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[CRuby] Revert a HTML4 parser bug in libxml 2.9.13 (introduced in Nokogiri v1.13.2). The bug causes libxml2's HTML4 parser to fail to recover when encountering a bare <code>&lt;</code> character in some contexts. This version of Nokogiri restores the earlier behavior, which is to recover from the parse error and treat the <code>&lt;</code> as normal character data (which will be serialized as <code>&amp;lt;</code> in a text node). The bug (and the fix) is only relevant when the <code>RECOVER</code> parse option is set, as it is by default.

external entities (XXE) by default. This fix turns off entity-resolution-by-default in the JRuby SAX parsers to match the CRuby SAX parsers' behavior.</p>\n<p>CRuby users are not affected by this CVE.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[CRuby] <code>Document#to_xhtml</code> properly serializes self-closing tags in libxml &gt; 2.9.10. A behavior change introduced in libxml 2.9.11 resulted in emitting start and and tags (e.g., <code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</code>) instead of a self-closing tag (e.g., <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>) in previous Nokogiri versions.

This fix turns off entity-resolution-by-default in the JRuby SAX parsers to match the CRuby SAX parsers' behavior.</p>\n<p>CRuby users are not affected by this CVE.</p>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[CRuby] <code>Document#to_xhtml</code> properly serializes self-closing tags in libxml &gt; 2.9.10. A behavior change introduced in libxml 2.9.11 resulted in emitting start and and tags (e.g., <code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</code>) instead of a self-closing tag (e.g., <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>) in previous Nokogiri versions. [<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2324\">#2324</a>]</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.12.4 / 2021-08-29</h2>\n<h3>Notable fix: Namespace inheritance</h3>\n<p>Namespace behavior when reparenting nodes has historically been poorly specified and the behavior diverged between CRuby and JRuby. As a result, making this behavior consistent in v1.12.0 introduced a breaking change.</p>\n<p>This patch release reverts the Builder behavior present in v1.12.0..v1.12.3 but keeps the Document behavior. This release also introduces a Document attribute to allow affected users to easily change this behavior for their legacy code without invasive changes.</p>\n<h4>Compensating Feature in XML::Document</h4>\n<p>This release of Nokogiri introduces a new <code>Document</code> boolean attribute, <code>namespace_inheritance</code>, which controls whether children should inherit a namespace when they are reparented. <code>Nokogiri::XML:Document</code> defaults this attribute to <code>false</code> meaning &quot;do not inherit,&quot; thereby making explicit the behavior change introduced in v1.12.0.</p>\n<p>CRuby users who desire the pre-v1.12.0 behavior may set <code>document.namespace_inheritance = true</code> before reparenting nodes.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Document.html#namespace_inheritance-instance_method\">https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Document.html#namespace_inheritance-instance_method</a> for example usage.</p>\n<h4>Fix for XML::Builder</h4>\n<p>However, recognizing that we want <code>Builder</code>-created children to inherit namespaces, Builder now will set <code>namespace_inheritance=true</code> on the underlying document for both JRuby and CRuby. This means that, on CRuby, the pre-v1.12.0 behavior is restored.</p>\n<p>Users who want to turn this behavior off may pass a keyword argument to the Builder constructor like so:</p>\n<pre lang=\"ruby\"><code>Nokogiri::XML::Builder.new(namespace_inheritance: false)\n</code></pre>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Builder.html#label-Namespace+inheritance\">https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Builder.html#label-Namespace+inheritance</a> for example usage.</p>\n<h4>Downstream gem maintainers</h4>\n<p>Note that any downstream gems may want to specifically omit Nokogiri v1.12.0--v1.12.3 from their dependency specification if they rely on child namespace inheritance:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

2022-02-21</h2>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[CRuby] Revert a HTML4 parser bug in libxml 2.9.13 (introduced in Nokogiri v1.13.2). The bug causes libxml2's HTML4 parser to fail to recover when encountering a bare <code>&lt;</code> character in some contexts. This version of Nokogiri restores the earlier behavior, which is to recover from the parse error and treat the <code>&lt;</code> as normal character data (which will be serialized as <code>&amp;lt;</code> in a text node). The bug (and the fix) is only relevant when the <code>RECOVER</code> parse option is set, as it is by default.
