distributed and look messy with new fix of 2 lines\n- Dates are long and cause some cards with longer month names to drop down to 2 lines, which misaligns that card to others when window size is reduced\n\n![7682bf8a-789c-49bd-bafc-b7377cc7b73a.png](https://images.zenhubusercontent.com/61e98ff375d0505e601dd00e/0f165d10-4810-4415-aec6-78bd44c0b61b)\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-05-18 at 10.21.10

outside, closes the menu but does not launch the goal card or any other action items\n- Buttons on goal cards are cleaned up\n- Delete button is moved down to the bottom of card and displayed in red\n- Dates reduced to a standard size (3 letter abbreviation possibly), long arrow image is replaced with something more space-saving\n\n", "reactions": {"url":

Form.io;\r\n- Created a type for the Form.io form to stop declaring it as any (`FormIOForm`). For backward compatibility some parameters were declared as `(forms: any[] | FormIOForm[])`;\r\n- Email notifications adjusted;\r\n- **Uploaded methods moved to the specific student/AEST controllers and upload/download logic centralized on the controller service**. This caused many changes but this will also make the upcoming ticket to reorganize the student API easier.\r\n- Many file uploads DTOs renamed but not moved yet;\r\n- Added a new file origin `Ministry` to be defined on the Ministry uploads a file to the student account;\r\n- Added a new button to the Ministry upload files to students, as shown below.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61259237/168900011-9d6488c5-9e05-4054-9c14-608251d21518.png)\r\n\r\n- Modal adjusted to me more like the one on Figma: icon removed,

For backward compatibility some parameters were declared as `(forms: any[] | FormIOForm[])`;\r\n- Email notifications adjusted;\r\n- **Uploaded methods moved to the specific student/AEST controllers and upload/download logic centralized on the controller service**. This caused many changes but this will also make the upcoming ticket to reorganize the student API easier.\r\n- Many file uploads DTOs renamed but not moved yet;\r\n- Added a new file origin `Ministry` to be defined on the Ministry uploads a file to the student account;\r\n- Added a new button to the Ministry upload files to students, as shown below.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61259237/168900011-9d6488c5-9e05-4054-9c14-608251d21518.png)\r\n\r\n- Modal adjusted to me more like the one on Figma: icon removed, title styles adjusted, added dividers, added spaces, as shown below.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61259237/168912117-9e0e8ac4-4a4b-4856-a177-f7a99c538f1d.png)\r\n\r\n-

fee. Right column should say no fee. If there is a quantity the price in the quantity section should be updated to $0.00. E.g. instead of 2 @ $10.00 each it would read 2 at $0.00 each\n\n2) Client Search for BC Registries Staff (MHR_Staff keycloak group)\n- when client search button is selected remove staff modal that is presented right away. Clicking client search should trigger search to complete so a user may view results and select those they wish to purchase\n- on review search result screen add section under folio or reference number on screen to capture staff payment options (BCOL, routing slip, no fee). Use staff payment shared component.\n- client must click 'Pay and Download Result' to complete search\n\nDo not change the staff payment flow for PPR.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bcgov/entity/issues/12174/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bcgov/entity/issues/12174/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}, "comment": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bcgov/entity/issues/comments/1130222357", "html_url": "https://github.com/bcgov/entity/issues/12174#issuecomment-1130222357", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bcgov/entity/issues/12174", "id": 1130222357, "node_id": "IC_kwDOCWnr0M5DXdMV", "user": {"login": "jinghualicgi", "id": 87034722, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDM0NzIy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87034722?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jinghualicgi", "html_url": "https://github.com/jinghualicgi", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jinghualicgi/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jinghualicgi/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jinghualicgi/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jinghualicgi/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jinghualicgi/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jinghualicgi/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jinghualicgi/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jinghualicgi/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jinghualicgi/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2022-05-18T16:18:21Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-18T16:18:21Z", "author_association": "COLLABORATOR", "body": "Hey team!
